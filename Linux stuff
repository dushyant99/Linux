First you have to consider that everything in Linux is a file, everything, whether it's your network settings, your ip address, the commands that you use in the terminal like ls, pwd, cd etc, everyting is a file, so you copy these files, delete them, do whatever you feel like with them
in the linux file hierarchy, there is a bin and sbin folder in roots folder and a same bin and sbin folder in the usr folder. Earlier once upon a time, these folders used to be different, bin folder in roots used to store data related to boot time and everything non-essential used to be stored in the /usr/bin folder but lately in modern linux systems, these folders are a symlink, they are same, one change will reflect in the other and if you use the 'which' command it will tell you that the main folder now is /usr/bin folder
Linux also has powershell (pwsh) which is basically another shell flavour from windows
In most modern linux systems, the root account is locked by default and you use sudo with your regular user account instead; to enable and set the root password later, you use "sudo passwd root" in the terminal. If you are running this command for the 1st time, then no old password is offcourse required but afterwards you would need to remember your root passwd otherwise if you forgot your Linux root password, you can regain access by restarting your system, entering the GRUB menu to boot into recovery Mode, dropping to a root shell, and using the "passwd" command to set a new one.

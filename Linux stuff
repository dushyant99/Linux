First you have to consider that everything in Linux is a file, everything, whether it's your network settings, your ip address, the commands that you use in the terminal like ls, pwd, cd etc, everyting is a file, so you copy these files, delete them, do whatever you feel like with them
in the linux file hierarchy, there is a bin and sbin folder in roots folder and a same bin and sbin folder in the usr folder. Earlier once upon a time, these folders used to be different, bin folder in roots used to store data related to boot time and everything non-essential used to be stored in the /usr/bin folder but lately in modern linux systems, these folders are a symlink, they are same, one change will reflect in the other and if you use the 'which' command it will tell you that the main folder now is /usr/bin folder

git clone https://github.com/dushyant99/Linux -- This clones the repo who want, in your local system, has to be done only the 1st time or if you are updating the local project after a long time (and there are many changes already made in the git project, say by someone else and you want those changes in your local project)
git status -- Tells you what files you edited, staged or ready to commit, basically it's your dashboard
git add Linux\ Commands or git add . -- adds your edited files into the "to be saved" area
git commit -m "Whatever msg you want to convey here, may be telling your future one what changes you made here in this version"
git push -- upload your commits to your online repo

All these commands are what you need on a daily basis from git:
clone once
status always
add what matters
commit to save
push to share

If you want to know how to undo any mistakes, please refer chatgpt for it, the command is git restore but with a few variations.

Fork vs clone (difference):
you clone when you just want a local copy on your machine, usually you do this only
you fork when you want a seperate copy of the project on your local machine but after fixing the code or making any changes you want to publish in your name

I am trying to access git from windows machine via kali linux on virtualBox
